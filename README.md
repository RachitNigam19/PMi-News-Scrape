# 🕸️ PM Modi-News-Scraper 
This repository contains a web scraping project that collects news data related to Narendra Modi, stored in a structured dataset (news_data.csv). Built with Python, this project demonstrates expertise in web scraping, data extraction, and data processing for real-world applications.
📖 Overview
The Modi News Scraper is a data collection project that extracts news articles or information related to Narendra Modi from web sources. The scraped data is compiled into a CSV file (news_data.csv) for further analysis or use in data science projects. This project showcases skills in web scraping, data cleaning, and Python programming.
🎯 Features

Scrapes web data related to Narendra Modi (e.g., news articles, headlines).
Stores extracted data in a structured CSV format (news_data.csv).
Implements robust web scraping techniques to handle dynamic web content.
Processes and cleans scraped data for analysis-ready output.
Modular code design for easy adaptation to other scraping tasks.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python: Core programming language.
BeautifulSoup/Scrapy: For web scraping and HTML parsing (assumed).
Pandas: For data manipulation and CSV output.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to web sources (assumed).
Git: Version control with .gitignore for clean repository management.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites

Python 3.8+
Git

Installation

Clone the repository:git clone https://github.com/RachitNigam19/Modi-News-Scraper.git
cd Modi-News-Scraper


Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

(Note: If requirements.txt is not present, install common scraping libraries: pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas or pip install scrapy pandas)

Usage

Run the scraping script (assumed to be in a Python file, e.g., scraper.py):python scraper.py


Check the output in news_data.csv for the scraped data.
Use the dataset for further analysis (e.g., in a Jupyter Notebook or data visualization tool).
